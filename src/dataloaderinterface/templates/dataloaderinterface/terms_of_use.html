                        <li><strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Stroud Water
                            Research Center and LimnoTech, their contractors, and their licensors, and their respective
                            directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses,
                            including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Website, including but not limited

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
                            Stroud Water Research Center, LimnoTech, and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and
                            they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Stroud
                            Water Research Center and LimnoTech, or by the posting by Stroud Water Research Center and
                            LimnoTech of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
                            otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be governed by the laws
                            of the state of Pennsylvania, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the
                            proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the
                            state and federal courts located in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Except for claims for
                            injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may
                            be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute concerning the
                            operation or performance of this agreement arises, the parties agree to first make good
                            faith efforts to resolve that dispute by negotiation between the parties. In the event the
                            dispute cannot be resolved by good faith negotiation, the parties agree to submit their
                            dispute to binding arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware, under such rules of procedure that
                            will permit both parties to fully discover and present all facts relevant to full and fair
                            resolution of the dispute. The parties agree that the purpose and intention of this
                            arbitration term is to advance the least time-consuming and least expensive means of
                            resolving any dispute that may arise between the parties. The prevailing party in any action
                            or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If
                            any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to
                            reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force
                            and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any
                            breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent
                            breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents
                            to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Stroud Water Research Center and
                            LimnoTech may assign their rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement
                            will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
                            permitted assigns.
